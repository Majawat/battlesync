# GF - BLESSED SISTERS V3.4.4

## INTRO

The Blessed Sisters are an elite force of religious warriors equipped with advanced armour and weaponry, which formed under the guidance of the God-Queen, a humble woman suddenly turned into a symbol of hope and resistance.

The sisterhoods act as mediators and rely on diplomacy rather than ruling through force. This has left them without the power and resources of other factions, dependent instead on an ever fragile web of alliances and donations.

## BACKGROUND STORY

The rise of a gene-scientist, known to history as the Founder, to supreme ruler of humanity, resulted in a devastating war that soon engulfed Earth and its colonies. As the war grew more devastating, many survivors began to seek a means to escape. A desperate group of refugees commandeered the Founder's own flagship in order to escape the conflict, leading a fleet of like-minded survivors.

The Founder caught the refugee fleet and forced an engagement on the edge of known space. Seeking to recapture his ship, his forces lead a number of boarding attacks on the refugee fleet. The Battle Brothers easily outmatched most refugee forces, until a mysterious young woman began to rally them together, displaying an almost supernatural ability to inspire confidence in her forces and fear in her foes. Together they repelled the initial attack, and some began to hope that they might manage to escape.

Then, a massive wormhole formed around the fleets. In an instant, both fleets were further damaged and separated by the wormhole. The colony fleet was scattered, but many sought out and followed the mysterious woman, looking out for suitable worlds to settle. Under her command, a makeshift fleet settled a few dispersed worlds where her diplomatic skills allowed them to thrive in relative peace.

Soon after arriving in Sirius, she began to develop psychic abilities. These abilities drew many acolytes and followers, inspiring many to name her their God-Queen. Fearful of the return of the Battle Brothers, the God-Queen decided to focus on training her own band of hand picked warriors. These became the Blessed Sisters and many of them came to truly believe she was divine.

After she sacrificed herself to kill an Avatar of Lust, worship of the God-Queen spread, and many new orders formed in her honour. These orders are often called on to protect allied worlds as peace-keepers and as arbitrators. The Blessed Sisters rely on volunteers, supplies and other donations from faithful worlds and followers.

Many worlds take their help for granted, making donations hard to come by, and forcing their orders to go through long periods of fasting and self-reflection to survive. When all else fails, the orders find themselves forced to turn on those they were seeking to protect, and establish martial law in order to survive.

How will you remain a beacon of hope in this grimdark future?
