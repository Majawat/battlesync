# COMMAND POINTS

## PLAYING WITH COMMAND POINTS

Command Points (CP) are an extra resource that can be added to the game, giving players access to critical tactical abilities that boost their units in battle.

Before the game begins, pick one of the following playstyles, or roll one die to randomly get one:

1. **Fixed** - At the start of the game, players get X CP, where X is 4 for every 1000pts in their army.

2. **Growing** - At the start of each round, players get X CP, where X is 1 for every 1000pts in their army.

3. **Temporary** - At the start of each round, players get X CP, where X is 1 for every 1000pts in their army, and unspent CP are discarded at the end of the round.

4. **Fixed Random** - At the start of the game, players get D3*X CP, where X is 2 for every 1000pts in their army.

5. **Growing Random** - At the start of each round, players get D3*X CP, where X is 0.5 (rounding up the total) for every 1000pts in their army.

6. **Temporary Random** - At the start of each round, players get D3*X CP, where X is 0.5 (rounding up the total) for every 1000pts in their army, and unspent CP are discarded at the end of the round.

## STRATAGEMS

At any point during the game, players may then spend their CP in order to activate stratagems, with each only being usable once per unit activation (friendly or enemy).

Players always have access to all stratagems from the universal doctrine, as well as those from one other doctrine.

Before the game begins, players must pick one of the following doctrines, or roll one die to randomly get one:

1. Strategic Doctrine
2. Defensive Doctrine
3. Shock Doctrine
4. Hunting Doctrine
5. Valorous Doctrine
6. Tactical Doctrine

## UNIVERSAL DOCTRINE

### High Command - 1 CP

Add +1 to the result of any single die.

*Example: A Dynasty Warrior (Quality 4+) is shooting, and rolls three results of 3. The player spends 1 CP to activate High Command and adds +1 to the result of a single die, scoring a total of 1 hit.*

### Supreme Command - 2 CP

Add +1 to the result of all dice in a single roll.

*Example: A Dynasty Warrior (Quality 4+) is shooting, and rolls three results of 3. The player spends 2 CPs to activate Supreme Command and adds +1 to the result of all dice, scoring a total of 3 hits.*

### Seize Initiative - 2 CP

When it's the enemy turn to activate a unit, you may activate one of your units instead. The opposing player may spend 2 CP in order to stop this ability from having any effect.

### Waive Initiative - 2 CP

When it's your turn to activate a unit, you force the opponent to activate one of their units instead. The opposing player may spend 2 CP in order to stop this ability from having any effect.

### Delayed Deployment - 2 CP

During the deployment phase, when it's your turn to place a unit, you may pass the turn to your opponent. The opposing player may spend 2 CP in order to stop this ability from having any effect.

### Hidden Deployment - 3 CP

After all units have deployed, you may remove up to 3 friendly units and place them again in any order. The opposing player may spend 3 CP to do the same, in which case players alternate in placing those units again.
