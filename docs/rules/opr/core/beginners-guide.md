## Welcome to Grimdark Future

Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive amongst the stars.

Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector. Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a Jumpgate.

Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.

Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.

Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds, whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.

Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities, zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to foster their own grim ambitions.

As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance, carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of the Sirius Sector.

How will you forge your path through this Grimdark Future?

## Basic Rules

### General Principles

When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference to resolve the situation.

If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use the following method in the interest of time.

Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of 4-6 player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the match, and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer details of the rules.

Note that whenever possible, players should agree on any rules and unusual situations (such as weirdly shaped models) before the game begins, to avoid issues later.

#### Models & Bases

This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind, which are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes, and we recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they come with.

Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:

• **Infantry:** 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases  
• **Large Infantry:** 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases  
• **Bikes:** 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases  
• **Monsters:** 70mm tall on 60mm round bases  
• **Large Walkers:** 100mm tall on 120mm oval bases  
• **Vehicles:** Various sizes and not mounted on a base

Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you keep base sizes consistent across all models.

#### Models & Units

In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as **models**, whilst groups of one or more models are referred to as **units**.

This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all miniatures within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it only applies to one individual miniature.

#### Unit Statistics

Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and what they can do.

• **Name [Size]:** The unit name and number of models.  
• **Quality:** The score needed for attacks and morale.  
• **Defense:** The score needed for defense.  
• **Equipment:** Any weapons and gear the unit has.  
• **Special Rules:** Any special rules the unit has.  
• **Cost:** How many points it costs to take this unit.

#### Dice

To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we will refer to as **D6**. Depending on how many models you are playing with, we recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.

Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you can combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll them all at once.

Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example D3, 2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation remains the same, so just apply the following explanations to all types of weird dice you come across.

• **D3:** To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve the result, rounding up.  
• **2D6:** To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum the results of both dice.  
• **D6+1:** To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1 to the result.

#### Re-Rolling Dice

Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of the second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the first.

A die roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many rules apply to it.

#### Roll-Offs

Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the roll-off must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player with the highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie the players must re-roll until there is a winner.

#### Quality Tests

During the game you will be required to take **Quality tests** in order to see if a model succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its targets or passing morale tests.

Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one die. If you score the model's Quality value or higher, then it counts as a success, else it counts as a fail.

**Example:** A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that the model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the 3).

#### Modifiers

Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers to your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a unit's roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.

Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or subtract the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final result, however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1 always counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified by.

**Example:** A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with a -1 modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5, but because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.

#### Weapons

All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: **ranged weapons** and **melee weapons**. Ranged weapons have a range value and can be used for shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value and can be used in melee.

Weapons profiles are represented like this:

• **Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)**

**Example:** Heavy Rifle (24", A1, AP(1))

#### Measuring Distances

To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which you may use to measure distances at any time:

• When measuring the distance between two models you always measure from/to the closest point of their bases.  
• When measuring the distance between two units you always measure from/to the closest model in each unit.

Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model has no base, then players must agree from where distances are to be measured (such as its hull/torso), and which unusual features may be ignored (like decorative banners or flame effects).

When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of its base moves further than the total distance.

Note that these movement restrictions apply in the same way to models on bases of any shape or models without a base.

#### Line of Sight

When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model can see another model for any purpose. Simply get down to the eye level of the miniature, and check if it can see the target. If the target is visible, then it has line of sight.

Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the miniature is actually facing, always have line of sight to themselves, and may always target themselves (unless stated otherwise).

Models can't see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other units (friendly or enemy), but they can always see through friendly models from their own unit.

Note that for players may agree to ignore unusual features (like decorative banners or flame effects) for line of sight.

---

### Preparation

#### The Battlefield

You are going to need a flat 6'x4' area to play on, which is usually referred to as "the battlefield" or "the table". Note that the game can be also played on smaller areas, as long as armies deploy at least 24" apart.

Whilst we recommend playing on a table, you can of course play on the floor, on a bed, or wherever else you have space.

#### Terrain

Once you have found a space to play, you are going to have to place at least 15 pieces of terrain on it, though we recommend using 20 or more to keep things interesting. Whilst it's always nice to play with great looking pieces of terrain, you can simply use household items such as books or cups as terrain.

There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, but we have provided some general guidelines in the terrain section of this book to help you get started.

#### Objective Markers

After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield.

The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first objective marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker each outside of the deployment zones, and over 9" away from other markers (note that markers can't be placed in unreachable positions, like impassable terrain or spots too tight to get to).

At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3" of a marker whilst no enemies are, then it counts as being seized.

Markers remain seized even if the unit moves away, but if units from both sides contest a marker at the end of a round, then it becomes neutral again.

After 4 rounds have been played, the game ends, and the player that controls most markers wins.

Note that unless stated otherwise, players don't ever win the game by fully destroying their opponent's army.

#### Army Building

Before the game begins, you and your opponent are going to have to agree on what size of game you want to play.

For a start we recommend playing with armies worth 1000pts each, and once you have gotten familiar with the game, you can start playing full matches with 2000pts armies each.

To put your army list together, simply select units and upgrades from one or more armies of your choice, and sum together their total point cost. There are no limitations as to how many units you can take, as long as their point cost doesn't go over the agreed total game size.

#### Force Organisation (Optional)

Optionally you and your opponent may agree to use the force organisation rules, which help make army composition more consistent and balanced.

The armies must follow these limitations:

• Only 1 hero per 500pts  
• Only 1+X copies of the same unit, where X is 1 per 1000pts (combined units count as one)  
• No single unit worth over 35% of total points  
• Only 1 unit per 200pts

**Example:** When playing a 2000pts game, players may bring max. 4 heroes, max. 3 copies of each unit, no unit worth over 700pts, and max. 10 units in total.

#### Combining Units

When preparing your army, you may combine two copies of the same multi-model into a single big unit, as long as any upgrades that are applied to all models are bought for both.

**Example:** A unit of Dynasty Warriors with Rifles cannot be merged with a unit of Dynasty Warriors with Shotguns, because they have two different upgrades that are applied to all models in the unit.

#### Deployment

Once the mission has been set up, the players roll-off and the winner must start deploying their army first.

The winning player first chooses one long table edge to deploy on and then places one unit fully within 12" of their table edge.

Once they are done, then the opposing player places one unit fully within 12" of the opposite table edge.

Then the players continue alternating in placing one unit each, until all units have been deployed.

---

### Game Structure & Movement

#### Game Structure

The game is structured into game rounds, player turns and unit activations. Here is the breakdown of what these mean:

• **Rounds:** Each round is made up of multiple turns.  
• **Turns:** Each turn is made up of a single activation.  
• **Activations:** Each activation is made up of an action.

After both players have deployed their armies, the game starts with the first round and the player that won the deployment roll-off takes the first turn.

During their turn, the player picks a unit that has not been activated yet, and activates it by performing an action.

Once the action has been taken, their turn ends, and the opposing player's turn starts. This continues until all units have activated, at which point the round ends and a new one begins. On each new round the player that finished activating first on the last round gets to activate first.

After 4 rounds have been played the game ends, and players determine who won by checking their mission objectives.

#### Unit Activation

Players must activate one unit that has not been activated yet and take one of the available actions:

• **Hold** - Doesn't move, can shoot.  
• **Advance** - Moves 6" and can shoot after moving.  
• **Rush** - Moves 12" but can't shoot.  
• **Charge** - Moves 12" into melee.

Note that Advance, Rush, and Charge actions may sometimes be referred to as "Move Actions".

#### Movement

Models may move and turn in any direction regardless of their facing, as long as no part of their bases move further than the total movement distance. Models may never be within 1" of models from other units, unless they are taking a Charge action, and may never move through other models or units (friendly or enemy), even if they are taking a Charge action.

Note that models may also never move outside of the battlefield (no part of them, at any point), or be placed in physically impossible locations.

#### Hold Action

When taking a Hold action, the models in the unit may not move, but may freely turn to face any direction.

#### Advance Action

When taking an Advance action, all models in the unit may move by up to 6".

#### Rush Action

When taking a Rush action, all models in the unit may move by up to 12".

#### Charge Action

When taking a Charge action, all models in the unit may move by up to 12", trying to reach base contact with one enemy unit, and may ignore the 1" distance restriction. Units may only take a Charge action if at least one model is within charge distance of the target unit (including any additional movement from special rules).

Note that Charge moves don't have to be in a straight line, and if being within charge distance becomes impossible (due to killed models, special rules, etc.), then the unit may complete its move in any direction and ends its activation.

#### Unit Coherency

All models in a unit must always stay within 1" of at least one other model, and must stay within 9" of all other models (or as close as possible), forming an uninterrupted chain of models in 1" coherency with each other.

If a model is not in coherency with its unit at the beginning of its activation, then you must take an action so that the model gets back into coherency.

---

### Shooting

#### Shooting Targets

When taking a Shooting action, a unit must pick one valid target and all models in the unit may shoot at it.

If at least one model in the unit has line of sight to an enemy model, and has a weapon that is within range of that model, then that enemy is a valid target.

All models in a unit with line of sight to the target, and that have a weapon that is within range of it, may fire at it. Note that models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit when determining line of sight.

**Example:** Only the three Dynasty Warriors in the middle can shoot at the Dwarves. The model at the top is in range but has no line of sight, whilst the model at the bottom has line of sight but is out of range.

#### Weapon Groups

If a unit is firing multiple weapon types, then you may separate each weapon type into its own weapon group.

Each group may be fired at a different target, however you may fire only at up to two different targets, and all weapons from the same group must fire at the same target.

Note that the target for each weapon group must be declared before rolling, and all weapons are fired simultaneously.

**Example:** A unit of Dynasty Warriors is armed with Rifles and a Plasma Rifle. Since they have two weapon types, the Dynasty Warriors can fire all the Rifles at a nearby Dwarf squad, and the Plasma Rifle at a distant Powersuit Guard.

#### Shooting Sequence

Shooting is done in a simple sequence which has to be followed separately for each weapon group:

1. Determine Attacks
2. Roll to Hit
3. Roll to Block
4. Remove Casualties

#### 1. Determine Attacks

Sum the Attack value from the weapons of all models that can shoot at the target to determine how many attacks the unit has in total for this shooting.

**Example:** A unit of five Dynasty Warriors is shooting at a unit of Dwarves. Three Dynasty Warriors with Rifles (Attack 1) are within range and line of sight of the Dwarves, which means the unit has a total of 3 attacks for this shooting.

#### 2. Roll to Hit

After having determined how many attacks the unit has in total, take as many Quality tests as attacks. Each successful roll counts as a hit, and all failed rolls are discarded with no effect.

**Example:** The three Dynasty Warriors (Quality 4+) are shooting at the Dwarves. They take three Quality tests and roll a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that they score a total of 2 hits.

#### 3. Roll to Block

For every hit that the unit has taken, the defending player must roll one die, trying to score the target's Defense value. Each success counts as a blocked hit, and all failed rolls cause one wound each to the target.

**Example:** The unit of Dwarves (Defense 4+) has taken two hits. They roll two dice and get a 3 and a 4. This means that the Dwarves have blocked 1 hit and taken 1 wound.

#### 4. Remove Casualties

For each wound that the unit has taken, the defending player must remove one model as a casualty.

The defending player may remove models from the target in any order, keeping unit coherency in mind.

---

### Melee

#### Melee Targets

When taking a Charge action, a unit must pick one valid target and all models in the unit must charge it.

If at least one model in the unit is within charge distance of one model from the target unit, and has a clear path to reach it, then that enemy is a valid target (no line of sight is needed).

#### Charge Movement

Charging models must move by up to 12" to get into base contact with an enemy model from the target unit, or as close as possible, whilst still maintaining unit coherency (charge moves don't have to be in a straight line).

Once all charging models have moved, all models from the target unit that are not in base contact with a charging model must move by up to 3" to get into base contact with a charging model, or as close as possible, maintaining unit coherency.

#### Melee Range

All models that are within 2" horizontally and 4" vertically of an enemy model from the target unit, may attack it.

Models must strike with all of their melee weapons, and may only strike at models from the target unit.

#### Melee Sequence

Melee is done in a simple sequence which has to be followed separately for the charging unit and the target unit:

1. Determine Attacks
2. Roll to Hit
3. Roll to Block
4. Remove Casualties

#### 1. Determine Attacks

Sum the Attack value from the weapons of all models that can strike at the target to determine how many attacks the unit has in total for this melee.

**Example:** A unit of five Dynasty Warriors is charging a unit of Dwarves. Three of the Dynasty Warriors armed with CCWs (Attack 1) are in range of the Dwarves, which means the unit has a total of 3 attacks for this melee.

#### 2. Roll to Hit

After having determined how many attacks the unit has in total, take as many Quality tests as attacks. Each successful roll counts as a hit, and all failed rolls are discarded with no effect.

**Example:** The three Dynasty Warriors (Quality 4+) are striking at the Dwarves. They take three Quality tests and roll a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that they score a total of 2 hits.

#### 3. Roll to Block

For every hit that the unit has taken, the defending player must roll one die, trying to score the target's Defense value. Each success counts as a blocked hit, and all failed rolls cause one wound each to the target.

**Example:** The unit of Dwarves (Defense 4+) has taken two hits. They roll two dice and get a 3 and a 4. This means that the Dwarves have blocked 1 hit and taken 1 wound.

#### 4. Remove Casualties

For each wound that the unit has taken, the defending player must remove one model as a casualty.

The defending player may remove models from the target in any order, keeping unit coherency in mind.

#### Striking Back

Once all charging models have attacked, the defending unit may choose to strike back (following the melee sequence again), but doesn't have to. Note that striking back does not count as its activation, and activated units may strike back.

#### Fatigue

After attacking in melee for the first time during a round, either by charging or by striking back, units only hit on unmodified rolls of 6 in melee until the end of that round.

---

### Melee Resolution & Morale

#### Melee Winner

Once the defender has struck back (or not if they chose not to strike back), you need to determine who won the melee.

Sum the total number of wounds that each unit caused, and compare the two. If one unit caused more wounds than the other, then it counts as the winner, and the opposing unit must take a morale test. Note that in melee only the loser takes a morale test, regardless of casualties.

If the units are tied for how many wounds they caused, or neither unit caused any wounds, then the melee is a tie and neither unit must take a morale test.

This means that if a unit didn't strike back in melee, then it must only take a morale test if it suffered at least one wound.

**Example:** A unit of Dynasty Warriors charges a unit of Dwarves. The Dynasty Warriors inflict 2 wounds in that melee, whilst the Dwarves only inflict 1 wound. Since the Dynasty Warriors caused more wounds, the Dwarves have lost and must take a morale test.

#### Consolidation

After determining who won the melee and taking morale tests, the units must make consolidation moves.

If one of the two units was destroyed (by removing all models as casualties, or by routing due to a failed morale test), then the other unit may move by up to 3".

If neither of the units was destroyed, then the charging unit must move back by 1" (if possible), to keep the separation between units clear, and show they are not locked in melee.

Note that players may agree not to separate units by 1" for simplicity, as long as they remember that units can still freely activate, move, shoot, charge, etc. despite being in contact.

#### Morale from Wounds

At the end of an activation in which a unit takes wounds that leave it with half or less of its starting size or tough value (for units with a single model), it must take a morale test.

Note that starting size is counted at the beginning of the game.

**Example:** A unit of Dynasty Warriors shoots at a unit of Dwarves that started the game with 10 models, and manages to kill 5. Since half of the Dwarves were killed, the unit must take a morale test.

To take a morale test, the affected unit must simply take one regular Quality test, and see what happens:

• If the test is passed, nothing happens.  
• If the test is failed, the unit is **Shaken**.

#### Morale from Melee

Units that were in melee don't take morale tests from wounds at the end of an activation, but must compare the number of wounds each unit caused instead. The unit with the lowest total loses, and must take a morale test.

Note that units that are destroyed in melee always count as having lost, and their opponent doesn't have to take a morale test, even if it dealt less wounds, or it previously took wounds that would have otherwise caused a morale test.

To take a morale test, the affected unit must simply take one regular Quality test, and see what happens:

• If the test is passed, nothing happens.  
• If the test is failed, and the unit still has over half or more of its starting size or tough value (for units with a single model), then the unit is **Shaken**.  
• If the test is failed, and the unit only has half or less of its starting size or tough value (for units with a single model), then the unit **Routs**.

#### Shaken

**Shaken** units must stay idle, always count as fatigued, always fail morale tests, and can't contest or seize objectives.

When activated, **Shaken** units must spend their activation being idle and doing nothing, which stops them from being Shaken at the end of their activation.

#### Routed

**Routed** units have lost all hope and are taken captive, flee the battle, or are otherwise rendered ineffective.

Simply remove the entire unit from the game as a casualty.

**Example:** A unit of 10 Dwarves has lost 5 models in melee and must take a morale test. The unit takes a morale test and fails, so it routs (as it only has half as many models left as it started with).

---

### Terrain

#### Terrain Rules

When setting up terrain, players must agree on what terrain type rules each piece of terrain follows. This will make sure that you do not have any arguments during your game, and that things can proceed smoothly.

Each piece of terrain may count as having multiple terrain types, and you may also add other conditions to further customize your terrain rules.

**Example:** A piece of Forest terrain could count both as Cover as well as Difficult Terrain. Additionally, you could allow units to shoot into and out of it freely, but not through it.

#### Open

**Examples:** Grass Fields, Dirt Roads, Streets, etc.

Any surface that is not specifically defined as a type of terrain (like forests, buildings, rivers, etc.) counts as open terrain.

Open terrain does not have any special rules, and any rules that affect terrain do not apply to open terrain.

#### Impassable

**Examples:** Mountains, Canyons, Deep Water, etc.

Any surface that would stop models from moving through it, as well as gaps over 1" wide, count as impassable terrain.

Units may not move through impassable terrain, unless they have any rules that allow them to ignore it. Note that units may move across gaps up to 1" wide as if they were flat ground, but may not end their move partially overhanging gaps or terrain.

#### Blocking

**Examples:** Walls, Buildings, Rocks, etc.

Any piece of terrain that models can't see or shoot through counts as blocking terrain.

Units may not draw line of sight through blocking terrain, unless they have any rules that allow them to ignore it.

#### Cover

**Examples:** Forests, Ruins, Sandbags, etc.

Terrain features that models can hide in or behind, or that could stop projectiles, count as cover terrain.

If the majority of models in a unit are fully inside a piece of cover terrain or behind a sight blocker (for multi-model units), or that are mostly inside cover terrain or behind sight blockers (for single-model units), they get +1 to Defense rolls when blocking hits from shooting attacks.

Note that other units are sight blockers and provide cover (despite not being terrain), since models can't see through the perimeter of other units (friendly or enemy).

#### Difficult

**Examples:** Woods, Mud, Rivers, etc.

Terrain features that hinder a model's movement, or force them to slow down, count as difficult terrain.

If any model in a unit moves in or through difficult terrain at any point of its move, then all models in the unit may not move more than 6" for that movement.

#### Dangerous

**Examples:** Quicksand, Razor Wire, Mine Fields, etc.

Terrain features that could harm models, or outright kill them, count as dangerous terrain.

If a model moves in or through dangerous terrain, or is activated in it, then it must take a dangerous terrain test.

To take a dangerous terrain test, roll one die (or as many dice as the model's Tough value), and if the result is 1, then the unit takes one automatic wound.

#### Elevated

**Examples:** Hills, Rooftops, Cliffs, etc.

Terrain features that are over 3" tall count as elevated terrain, and are impassable, but any terrain piece that is up to 3" tall may be climbed as part of a unit's move (units may not end their move mid-climb).

Note that short terrain up to 1" tall may be ignored for the purposes of movement (instead of having to climb up 1" and down 1" to cross it).

#### Terrain Guidelines

Whilst there are no specific rules as to how terrain should be placed, here are some guidelines on how to handle terrain to have a balanced match.

Here are all the things you should consider:

• Size of your terrain  
• Rules for each terrain  
• Number of pieces  
• How to place it

##### Terrain Size

Whilst there is no limit to the size of terrain that you can use for your games, we have a few recommendations for you:

• Small pieces of scatter terrain, like barrels, boxes, barricades, etc. should be somewhere between 1"x1" and 3"x3" in size.  
• Large terrain features, like buildings, forests, lakes, etc. should be somewhere between 4"x4" and 8"x8" in size, but can be as large as 12"x12".

##### Terrain Types

For each terrain feature you'll also have to define some basic rules for how it works in the game. Most terrain features will probably have a single type, but you can combine multiple types together, and even add extra conditions to them.

Here are some guidelines for common terrain types:

• **Barricades** - Cover  
• **Buildings** - Impassable + Blocking  
• **Fields** - Difficult + Cover  
• **Forests** - Difficult + Cover + Units can see into and out of forests, but not through them  
• **Hills** - Cover + Difficult when moving up + Units on top may ignore one unit/terrain for line of sight  
• **Lakes** - Difficult (if shallow) or Impassable (if deep)  
• **Lava** - Dangerous  
• **Mountains** - Impassable + Blocking  
• **Rivers** - Dangerous when using rush/charge  
• **Rubble** - Difficult  
• **Ruins** - Cover + Dangerous when using rush/charge  
• **Swamps** - Difficult

Note that whilst all of the terrain we mentioned so far is what you'll need for gameplay purposes, it's also always good to have elements of decorative terrain that have no effect on the game, but that help make your table look better.

These could be elements such as patches of grass, shallow water puddles, scattered gravel, chain-link fences, street signs, and other things that make sense for your table.

##### Number of Pieces

When setting up terrain, you should use at least 15-20 pieces of terrain, although using more can be more interesting.

A simple way to make sure that you're using enough terrain is to take as many pieces of terrain as you need to fully cover at least 25% of the table, and then spread them out.

It's also good to keep a balance of different terrain types, so that units with different weapons and special rules can use them effectively in various situations.

Here are some basic terrain type recommendations:

• At least 50% should block line of sight  
• At least 33% should provide cover  
• At least 33% should be difficult terrain  
• Each player should pick 1 piece to be dangerous

**Example:** If you're playing with 12 pieces of terrain, at least 6 should block line of sight, 4 should provide cover, 4 should be difficult terrain, and 2 should be dangerous terrain.

##### Terrain Placement

Once you have chosen which terrain pieces you are going to use, you can either have one player set up all of the terrain, or have both players set up terrain together.

To make sure neither player has an advantage, you can roll-off, and then then alternate in placing one terrain piece each, starting with the player that won the roll-off.

There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, so we recommend trying to set up the table in such a way that it will provide a balanced playing field for everyone involved.

Ideally you want to place enough blocking terrain that you can't draw clear line of sight from edge to edge across the table, as well as make sure that there are no gaps bigger than 12" between different terrain pieces. If you are playing with large units, we also recommend making sure that there are gaps of at least 6" between terrain, so they can fit through.

### Special Rules

Most units have one or more special rules that affect the way they behave, and that sometimes go against the standard rules.

Whenever you come across one of these situations, the special rule always takes precedence over the standard rules.

Note that effects from multiple instances of the same special rule or spell don't stack, unless it is a rule with (X) in its name, or unless it is specified otherwise.

#### Aircraft

May only use Advance actions, moving in a straight line, and adding 30" to its total move (even if Shaken). Aircraft ignore all units and terrain when moving and stopping, can't seize objectives, can't be charged, and units targeting them get -12" range and -1 to hit.

Note that whilst Aircraft models are flying above their ground, their base doesn't block movement or line of sight, and units may move and shoot under them (only the actual model is used for purposes of blocking movement and line of sight). Aircraft can't move into the table edges to move less than 30", and their mandatory move doesn't break the staying idle requirement to stop being Shaken.

#### Ambush

May be set aside before deployment. At the start of any round after the first, may be deployed anywhere over 9" away from enemy units. Players alternate in placing Ambushers, starting with the player that activates next. Units that deploy via Ambush can't seize or contest objectives on the round they deploy.

#### AP(X)

Targets get -X to Defense rolls when blocking hits from weapons with this special rule.

#### Blast(X)

Ignores cover, and after resolving other special rules, each hit is multiplied by X, where X is up to as many hits as models in the target unit.

**Example:** A weapon with 2 Attacks and Blast(3) scores two hits against a unit with 2 models. Each hit is multiplied by 2, so the target takes a total of 4 hits.

#### Caster(X)

Gets X spell tokens at the start of each round, but can't hold more than 6 tokens at once. At any point before attacking, spend as many tokens as the spell's value to try casting one or more spells (only one try per spell). Roll one die, on 4+ resolve the effect on a target in line of sight. Models within 18" in line of sight of the caster's unit may spend any number of spell tokens at the same time before rolling, to give the caster +1/-1 to the roll per token.

Note that Casters get spell tokens each round even if they are not on the table (waiting to Ambush for example), and that the Caster's spells must be picked from their own faction.

#### Counter

Strikes first with this weapon when charged, and the charging unit gets -1 total Impact rolls per model with Counter.

**Example:** A model with Impact(3) charges a unit with 1 model that has Counter, so it only makes 2 Impact rolls.

#### Deadly(X)

Assign each wound to one model, and multiply it by X. Hits from Deadly must be resolved first, and these wounds don't carry over to other models if the original target is killed.

#### Entrenched

Enemies get -2 to hit when shooting at models with this special rule from over 9" away, as long as the Entrenched model hasn't moved since the beginning of its last activation.

#### Fast

Models with this special rule move +2" when using Advance and +4" when using Rush/Charge.

#### Fear(X)

This model counts as having dealt +X wounds when checking who won melee.

#### Fearless

Whenever a unit where most models have this rule fails a morale test, roll one die. On a 4+ it counts as passed instead.

#### Flying

Models with this special rule may move through units and terrain, and ignore terrain effects whilst moving.

#### Furious

When charging, unmodified rolls of 6 to hit in melee deal one extra hit (only the original hit counts as a 6 for special rules).

**Example:** A Furious model with a weapon with 1 Attack and Rending scores one hit on a roll of 6, so it deals two hits, of which only the first counts as having AP(4) because of Rending.

#### Hero

Heroes with up to Tough(6) may deploy as part of one multi-model unit without another Hero. The hero may take morale tests on behalf of the unit, but must use the unit's Defense until all other models have been killed.

Note that when a Hero joins a unit, they count as part of that unit, so the unit's size is increased by 1, and even if the hero is the last model remaining, it takes morale tests as the unit. This also means that a hero may never leave its unit or join another one.

**Example:** A Hero joins a unit of [5] models, so the unit's size is [6]. Once all other models have been killed, the Hero must take a morale test whenever it takes wounds, and if it fails a morale test in melee it will Rout, because it's a unit with half or less of its starting size.

#### Immobile

Models with this special rule may only use Hold actions.

#### Impact(X)

Roll X dice when attacking after charging, unless fatigued. For each 2+ the target takes one hit.

#### Indirect

Gets -1 to hit rolls when shooting after moving. May target enemies that are not in line of sight as if in line of sight, and ignores cover from sight obstructions.

#### Lance

When charging, gets +1 to hit rolls and AP(+1) in melee.

#### Lock-On

Ignores cover and all negative modifiers to hit rolls and range.

#### Limited

Weapons with this rule may only be used once per game.

#### Poison

This weapon ignores Regeneration, and the target must re-roll unmodified Defense rolls of 6 when blocking hits.

Note that a die roll may only be re-rolled once, so if another 6 is rolled after re-rolling Defense, then the hit is blocked.

#### Regeneration

When taking a wound, roll one die. On a 5+ it is ignored.

#### Relentless

When this model uses a Hold action and shoots, unmodified rolls of 6 to hit deal one extra hit (only the original hit counts as a 6 for special rules).

Note: Check out the examples from the Furious special rule.

#### Reliable

Models attacks at Quality 2+ with this weapon.

Note that Reliable only changes the Quality value, so the roll can still be modified, Fatigue still applies, etc.

#### Rending

This weapon ignores Regeneration, and unmodified rolls of 6 to hit get AP(4).

#### Scout

May be set aside before deployment. After all other units are deployed, must be deployed and may then be placed anywhere within 12" of their position. Players alternate in placing Scout units, starting with the player that activates next.

#### Slow

Models with this special rule move -2" when using Advance, and -4" when using Rush/Charge.

#### Sniper

Shoots at Quality 2+, and each model with Sniper may pick any model in the target unit as its individual target, which is resolved as if it was a unit of 1. Sniper weapon shooting must be resolved before other weapons.

Note that other models in the target's unit don't block line of sight or provide cover to the target model in the unit.

**Example:** A Sniper targets a Hero that has Stealth, and is in a unit with Regeneration but not Stealth. Since the shooting is resolved as if the target was a unit of 1, the Sniper gets -1 to hit from Stealth, and the target doesn't get Regeneration.

#### Stealth

Enemies get -1 to hit rolls when shooting at units where all models have this rule from over 9" away.

#### Strider

May ignore the effects of difficult terrain when moving.

#### Tough(X)

This model must take X wounds before being killed. If a model with tough joins a unit without it, then it is removed last when the unit takes wounds. Note that you must continue to put wounds on the tough model with most wounds in the unit until it is killed, before starting to put them on the next tough model (heroes must be assigned wounds last).

#### Transport(X)

May transport up to X models or Heroes with up to Tough(6), and non-Heroes with up to Tough(3) which occupy 3 spaces each. Transports may deploy with units inside, and units may enter/exit by using any move action, but must stay fully within 6" of it when exiting. When a transport is destroyed, units inside must take a dangerous terrain test, are Shaken, and must be placed fully within 6" of the transport before removal.

Note that units inside Transports are deployed at the same time as the Transport, and units can't both embark/disembark as part of the same activation. Units inside/outside of Transports don't have line of sight to the outside/inside, so they can't target each other for shooting, spells, etc. (but units inside can target other units inside, and the Transport itself). Units may use Charge actions to disembark, and they ignore the 1" move restriction when embarking (only one model needs to reach the Transport for everyone to embark).

**Example:** Regular models and Heroes with Tough(3) or Tough(6) occupy 1 space, Tough(3) models occupy 3 spaces, and models with Tough(6) or higher can't be transported. This means that a unit of 10 regular models with a Tough(3) Hero occupy 11 spaces in total.
