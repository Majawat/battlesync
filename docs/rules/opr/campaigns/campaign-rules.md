# CAMPAIGN RULES v3.4.0

**Copyright © OPR Games. All Rights Reserved | Created By: Gaetano Ferrara | www.onepagerules.com**

## Campaign Setup

**Campaign Length:** Campaigns are played with two or more players, and you must pick one of these campaign types:

• **Game-Limited:** Play D6+4 missions, and after the last match the player with most VP wins.
• **Point-Limited:** The campaign ends when one player has earned D6+4 VP after a match, who wins.
• **Time-Limited:** The campaign ends after D6+4 weeks, and the player with most VP at the end wins.
• **Endless:** The campaign never ends, but instead players keep track of how many VPs they earned on an ongoing campaign leaderboard.

**Parallel Play:** Usually all armies should participate in every match, but if you want you can allow armies to play matches in parallel. If you do, then each army's VP must be divided by the amount of matches they play, to get their final VP score.

**Late Joiners:** If you want you can allow players to join the campaign whilst it's already ongoing. If you do, then they start with a regular army, and you must count VP as in parallel play.

**The Armies:** Before the first mission each player receives 1000pts to spend on their army. Players may save up to 200pts to be spent later, and they may only buy one unit with the Hero rule.

**The Army Sheet:** Each army and unit must be given a unique name, which you can fill out on the army sheet.

## Campaign Structure

Campaigns are played with the following structure:

1. Mission Setup
2. Play Mission
3. Check for Casualties
4. Earn Experience
5. Upgrade Armies
6. Recruit Units

Each step must be followed in this order and once all steps have been completed you start from the first again.

## Army Rules

**The Armies:** There are no point limits in campaign games, however no army may bring over 250pts worth of units more than the army with the lowest point value.

**Underdog Bonus:** Any army that has a point value lower than at least one other gets an underdog bonus. You get 1 underdog point for every 50pts difference between your army and the one with the highest value. Each underdog point can be spent to modify all dice in a friendly or enemy roll by +1 or -1, but only one point can be spent per roll.

## Special Objectives

In addition to the mission objectives, players may earn a bonus of 75pts by completing special objectives. Roll one die each to see which objective you get:

| Result | Objective |
|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Mastery** - One friendly unit in each table quarter at the end. |
| 2 | **Honor** - No enemy units in own deployment zone at the end. |
| 3 | **Casting** - At least one attempt to cast a spell per round. |
| 4 | **Recovery** - First player to stop a unit from being shaken. |
| 5 | **Rage** - First player to destroy an enemy unit. |
| 6 | **Destruction** - Most expensive enemy unit destroyed. |

If you roll an objective which can't be completed, then you must re-roll.

## Mission Rules

**Mission Length:** Missions are played using the standard rules, however if after 4 rounds there is no winner, the game continues onto the next round until there is one winner.

**Conceding:** At the beginning of any round players may concede, removing all of their units from the table, which don't count as casualties for this mission.

**Random Events:** At the beginning of each round players must roll one die, and on a 5+ a random event happens.

**Mission Goals:** The winning army gets 2 VP and 150pts, whilst all losing armies get 300pts.

## Casualties

At the end of the game, all units that were fully destroyed or routed count as casualties for this mission.

### Regular Units
For every unit that is a casualty roll one die to see what happens:

| Result | Casualty |
|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Dead** - Remove the unit from your army sheet. |
| 2-5 | **Recovered** - Unit recovers and may be used without penalties. |
| 6 | **Natural Talent** - Unit recovers and earns +1 XP. |

### Hero Units
Follow the same rules as above, however on a 1 it becomes 5pts cheaper and gets an Injury trait, and on a 6 it becomes 5pts more expensive and gains a Talent trait. Each trait can only be gained once, so if you roll the same result simply re-roll.

#### Injury Traits

| Result | Injury Trait |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Dead** - Remove the hero from your army sheet. |
| 2 | **Chest Wound** - Gets -1 to rolls when blocking hits. |
| 3 | **Blinded Eye** - Gets -1 to rolls when shooting. |
| 4 | **Arm Injury** - Gets -1 to rolls when in melee. |
| 5 | **Traumatized** - Gets -1 to rolls when taking morale tests. |
| 6 | **Smashed Leg** - Moves -1" on advance and -2" on rush and charge actions. |

#### Talent Traits

| Result | Talent Trait |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Natural Talent** - The hero recovers and gets +1 XP. |
| 2 | **Motivated** - Always passes the first morale test of the match. |
| 3 | **Crazed** - Gets +1 attack in melee when charging. |
| 4 | **Bitter Rivalry** - Gets +1 to hit against enemy heroes. |
| 5 | **Horrible Scars** - Enemy units get -1 to hit when in melee against the hero. |
| 6 | **Toughened** - Gets Tough(+1). |

**No Permadeath:** Optionally you can play without units being removed from the army when they die, but instead they lose all XP earned during the match and must sit out the next D3 matches.

## Experience System

### Earning XP
Units earn XP in battle for each of the following things:

• +1 XP: Not a casualty
• +1 XP: Killed a unit
• +2 XP: Killed a hero unit
• +3 XP: Killed a hero and its unit

Mark earned XP on the army sheet in order to see when units level up.

### Regular Units
When a unit earns 5 XP it becomes 25pts more expensive and you roll one die to see what trait it gets:

| Result | Trait |
|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Agile** - Moves +1" on advance and +2" on rush and charge. |
| 2 | **Headstrong** - Gets +1 to rolls when taking morale tests. |
| 3 | **Specialist** - Gets +1 to rolls in melee or shooting (pick one). |
| 4 | **Resilient** - Gets +1 to rolls when blocking hits. |
| 5 | **Elite** - May re-roll one roll of any kind once per game. |
| 6 | **Fast Learner** - May pick any other trait from the list. |

Each trait (except for Specialist) can only be gained once, and if you roll a trait you already have simply re-roll. Units can't earn more than 30xp, so they can level up max. 6 times.

### Hero Units
Follow the same rules as above, but heroes become 55pts more expensive (instead of only 25pts) when they level up. The first time a hero levels up roll one die and pick one skill set:

| Result | Skill Set |
|--------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Captain or Support |
| 3-4 | Fighter or Shooter |
| 5-6 | Pathfinder or Healer |

Every time the hero levels up, including the first time, roll one die to see what skill trait it gets from its skill set. Each trait can only be gained once, so if you roll a trait you already have simply re-roll. If a hero already has all 3 traits of its skill set, then it may roll on the table again to get a new second skill set.

#### Captain
The hero shines as a leader and their men follow with pride.

| Result | Skill Trait |
|--------|-------------|

## Army Management

### Buying Upgrades
Players may buy upgrades for their units as detailed in their army page by spending any points they have available. When buying upgrades worth less than 0pts, you gain those points instead of spending them.

### Selling Upgrades
Players may sell any of their upgrades at half of their original price (rounding down to the nearest multiple of 5). If an item is only worth 5pts roll one die, on a 1-3 the item can't be sold, on a 4+ it can be sold for 5pts (you can only try to sell a 5pts item once after each mission). When selling upgrades worth less than 0pts, you must spend their full points cost instead of gaining them.

### Recruiting Heroes
Players may recruit up to one new hero after each mission, and may only have 3 heroes in their army at once.

### Recruiting Regular Units
Players may recruit as many regular units as they want after each mission. One of the new recruited units may also start with 5 XP if the player pays +50pts for it.

### Disbanding Units
Any unit may be freely disbanded, losing all of its XP and upgrades. Players may also choose to disband their full army, losing all units, VP, points, etc. and start a new army from scratch.

## Random Events

### Rolling for Random Events
When rolling for random events, roll two separate dice one at a time, where the first one represents the first number, whilst the second one represents the second number, and resolve that event.

**Example:** A player rolls two dice, with the first result being a 2 and the rescond result being a 1. This would mean that event 21 is chosen.

### Rolling for Random Units
If a random event calls for randomly selecting a unit from any warband you must first randomly select a warband for the event, and then randomly select a unit to be the target.
