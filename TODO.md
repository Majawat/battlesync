## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **TypeScript First**: All new code must be TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Mobile First**: UI components designed for mobile devices primarily
- **Real-time by Default**: Use WebSockets for live updates where applicable
- **Docker for Development**: Consistent development environment across team
- **Prisma for Database**: Type-safe database operations with migration support

### User Feedback Integration
- **Group Capacity Removed**: Per user request, gaming groups no longer have member limits
- **Army Management Priority**: User identified as high priority after basic campaign features
- **Battle Tracking Complexity**: User noted this will be the most complex feature to implement

### Performance Considerations
- **Gaming Group Isolation**: Ensure data isolation between different gaming groups
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Plan for multiple concurrent battle rooms
- **Database Optimization**: Use JSONB for flexible army data storage
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for ArmyForge API responses

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Code Review Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Code review and approval required
5. Merge to `develop` and test
6. Release to `main` when stable

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Manual testing checklist before releases

### Release Process
1. Feature freeze on `develop`
2. Create release branch
3. Final testing and bug fixes
4. Merge to `main` and tag release
5. Deploy to production environment
6. Monitor for issues and hotfix if needed
